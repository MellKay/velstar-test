# Notes

I've created basic HTML, CSS and JS files which will show the page as per the design, but I've also roughly recreated the files in a Liquid format to show how I would go about creating the page using that.

I've added some comments in where needed to explain some of my choices.

I've built the liquid assuming this would be a landing page but could be reworked to fit a collection page easily.

The settings in [page.landing.json]('liquid-examples/templates/page.landing.json) were manually written out.
